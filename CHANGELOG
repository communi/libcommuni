    is built into the plugin, making it available on all platforms
  - An alternative message decoder plugin based on ICU is available
    in src/plugins/icu must be enabled/built by hand. It requires
    the presence of ICU (modify icu.pri if necessary) that is not
    available for all Communi supported platforms
  - The used message decoder plugin may be controlled by setting the
    COMMUNI_CODEC_PLUGIN (values: uchardet,icu) environment variable
